         <p class="justify">The human brain is more complex than any other known structure in the universe. And tapping into the
            immense potential of the conscious and subconscious mind to seek answers, find root causes and
            create life-long permanent solutions to stress, disorders, phobias, anxieties and challenges is what
            we are all about.
         </p>
         <p class="justify">Welcome to SwaDarshana, a state-of-the-art healing & experience centre that balances the most
            scientific approach with age-old spiritual values to transform your life in more ways than you could
            imagine.
         </p>
         <p class="justify">SwaDarshana, the name combines ‘Swa’ (meaning, the self) and ‘Darshana’ (meaning, an auspicious
            glimpse).
         </p>
         <p class="justify">We help you connect with your own inner self, your subconscious (or unconscious) mind at the deepest
            level to transform your outlook, recharge your energies and deep-dive into the exact root cause
            behind your challenges. We use the power of Hypnotherapy to help deal with anxiety, depression,
            fear, phobia, stress, channelizing emotions, inner healing, goal setting, identifying life-purpose
            and deal with the traumatic state of physical or mental conditions.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-12" style="margin-top: 34px;">
         <p class="justify">Besides Hypnotherapy, SwaDarshana is equipped with one of its kind Consecrated Meditative space that
            allows an individual to reach a heightened state of meditation and peace.
         </p>
         <p class="justify">We also have an advanced Sound Healing centre, offering a uniquely relaxing ‘darkroom therapy’ that
            helps an individual experience the pinnacle of inner-peace and relaxation.
         </p>
         <p class="justify">We also conduct special group sessions on ‘Full Moon’ days which is a one of its kind experience in
            itself when it comes to feeling and healing through nature’s very own energies.
         </p>
         <p class="justify">Our other modalities and healing techniques help you connect deeply with cosmic vibrations and
            manifest miracles by way of Aura check, Chakra Reading and Tarot Card reading, Reiki,Silva, Access
            Bars, Candle Healing, Twin Heart Meditations etc.
         </p>
         <p class="justify">Hypnosis helps you attain the supreme state of consciousness and magically unfolds pages and chapters
            of your life hidden deep within your subconscious mind.
         </p>
         <p id="about2" class="justify">It helps manifest positive thoughts, actions and vibrations by connecting with your inner-most self
            and holistically transforms your life in more ways than you can imagine.
         </p>
         <p class="justify">What’s more, this alternate technique is absolutely safe, does not involve medicines and is does not
            usually involve prolonged consultations.
         </p>
         <p class="justify">This is so because we at SwaDarshana believe in identifying and eliminating root causes rather than
            addressing symptoms, making the results last a lifetime.
