                            <p class="excerpt1 hedd"> <strong> It Can Help You Lose Weight:</strong> </p>
                            <p class="excerpt1"> Painful, unhealthy dieting and overexerting yourself with too much exercise have long been hailed as the ways to go if you want to lose weight. Despite the fact that these are strategies that can actually harm your body in the long run, almost everyone has deprived themselves of nutrients in the name of losing a few pounds. If you’ve tried this before, you know that it’s ineffective as well as being awful. On the other hand, hypnosis is easy, painless, and proven highly effective. A clinical study of 60 overweight women shows this. On average, they lost 17 LBS over their time in hypnotherapy, which is 30 times more than those who didn’t use these methods! </p>

                                <p class="excerpt1"> Hypnosis has been around since ancient times. Its believed that the Egyptians used hypnosis for surgical procedures and religious purposes. Hieroglyphics found in ancient tombs suggested this.
                                It’s thought that these hieroglyphics are from around 3000 BC, showing how long hypnosis has been used to treat people. Since hypnosis was originally associated with religious rites, people conceived inaccurate myths about the practice.
                                </p>

                                <p class="excerpt1 hedd"> <strong>Amnesia or Losing Consciousness</strong> </p>
                                <p class="excerpt1"> people are taken into a deep trance. Spontaneous amnesia may accompany this, but only in extremely rare circumstances. However, most people will remember everything from their hypnosis. A therapist may help you to recall an experience that you have forgotten, but you will remember what you discussed during your session.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="excerpt1 hedd"> <strong>Mind Control: </strong> </p>
                                <p class="excerpt1">Real-life hypnosis is very different from what you would see on television or in the movies. Your hypnotherapist is not going to control your mind. You are the only person who can do that. Your hypnotherapist will make suggestions to help you overcome fears or anxieties. They will also make suggestions to assist you with quitting any unwanted habits. As suggestions are made, if you disagree or are confused, your subconscious will fail to accept the request. You will be safe from mind control at all times. </p>

                                <p class="excerpt1 hedd"> <strong>You’re Asleep While Hypnotized:</strong> </p>
                                <p class="excerpt1"> when you’re hypnotized, you’re completely aware of your surroundings. Your eyes are closed to help with focus and concentration and so  you’re typically in a heightened state of awareness. That’s the exact opposite of being asleep. Your body is extremely relaxed, as is your mind. You will still have control of your senses and will be aware of your surroundings at all times. </p>

                                <p class="excerpt1 hedd"> <strong>You Think You’ve Never Been Hypnotized:  </strong> </p>
                                <p class="excerpt1"> have you ever caught yourself in a daydream or being part of some book fiction or movie? If yes, then you’ve been hypnotized. You’re wide awake, but you lose awareness of your surroundings. This is because you are so acutely focused on the task at hand that everything else fades into the background. It’s not that you’ve lost consciousness or have fallen asleep. You’re just hyper-focused at that particular moment.  </p>

                                <p class="excerpt1 hedd"> <strong>Hypnosis Can Manipulate People Into Admitting Hidden Truths:  </strong> </p>
                                <p class="excerpt1"> movies and stage acts may have led you to believe that you will be completely powerless and dominated to act against your wish.. This simply is not true. What actually happens is: hypnosis allows you to learn things about yourself you may have forgotten. It helps you connect with your subconscious. This allows you to understand feelings of yours that may have confused you previously. Since you are completely awake the entire time, you’ll never admit anything against your will. You are in complete control of what you do or don’t say. </p>

                                <p class="excerpt1 hedd"> <strong>Hypnotherapists are Supernatural or Have “Magical Powers”:  </strong> </p>
                                <p class="excerpt1"> hypnotherapists are not mystical supernatural beings. They are trained professionals who will work with you and discuss treatment goals, depending on the results you look to achieve. Sometimes, a hypnotherapist will work with you using guided imagery. This type of hypnosis can help you with body and mind issues you may have. While the results of hypnosis may seem magical, it’s important to understand that this isn’t because of anything supernatural. It’s just your amazing brain at work. </p>
